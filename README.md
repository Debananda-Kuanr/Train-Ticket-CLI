# Train-Ticket-CLI
🚆 Train Ticket Booking System (Java Console App)

This is a simple Java-based console application for simulating a train ticket booking system. The program allows users to input passenger details, generates random serial numbers for tickets, and displays a formatted booking summary. It's a beginner-friendly project ideal for learning Java basics like arrays, loops, and user input handling.

🎯 Features

✅ Book multiple train tickets at once

🎫 Auto-generates random serial numbers for each ticket

👤 Captures passenger name and age

📄 Displays a formatted booking summary after input

💰 Static ticket price assigned to each booking

🔒 Uses basic input validation and clean console output


🛠 Technologies Used

Java (Core) – Input handling, arrays, Random class, Scanner, loops


🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.


2. Compile the code:

javac trainticket.java


3. Run the program:

java trainticket

📌 Note

This is a console-based frontend simulation only — it doesn’t store data or connect to a real ticketing system.

Serial numbers are randomly generated between 1000 and 9999.

The line in.nextLine(); after reading the number of tickets is required to consume the newline character left in the buffer.


📚 Learning Goals

Practice Java syntax, input/output, and logic building

Understand how to use arrays and loops to manage user data

Improve CLI formatting and user interaction skills
